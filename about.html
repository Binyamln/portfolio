        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Binyamin Abukar—a passionate computer science student at the University of Louisville. I’m currently pursuing both a B.A. and an upcoming M.S. in Computer Science, with a strong foundation in software engineering, data structures, machine learning, and algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience includes internships at companies such as PPL Electric Utilities and Siemens, where I have worked on SQL solutions, front-end interfaces, and software development projects. I also serve as a Diversity Student Ambassador, guiding prospective students through campus life.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I love working on innovative projects including a 2D dungeon crawling game, a VR car repair simulator, and a motivational pet simulation app. I’m always eager to collaborate and bring tech ideas to life.
